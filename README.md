iCloset February 19th, 2022

Overview Nowadays, people own a decent amount of clothes but still have nothing to wear most of the time. It happens so because people find it hard to choose among a variety of options or they just forget clothes that are buried in the back of their closets. Our target customers are those who are tired of standing in front of their wardrobes choosing what to wear in their busy mornings. By introducing iCloset, all these problems can be well addressed.

Scope iCloset is a web application that creates personal online wardrobe space for users to digitally plan outfits and maintain an organized clothing system. Users can sign up and log in to their private account, upload photos of their clothes, categorize items into various categories, code outfits according to weather or seasons, create customized tags and add outfits to their calendars to track what they wish to wear. iCloset also allows users to group different items (with background removed) into an outfit and save outfit collages. Users can spend quality time flipping through their saved outfits, plan with personal calendars without even actually trying them on. In addition to the above basic features, a public outfit collage page will be accessible to all users. There, users can choose to share their selected outfit collages, view others’ combinations and give a thumb up.

API iCloset will utilize APIs to automatically remove the background of those uploaded photos, update weather forecasts and get access to the digital calendar.

SWOT Analysis Strength It is convenient and clear to manage the user’s clothing/closet with the application. Users can match clothes faster making life more efficient.

Weakness It takes a certain amount of time to organize your closet for the first time. Also, compared to mobile applications, our web application may not be as convenient.

Opportunities None of the competition sites has yet introduced a social interaction system. We can develop a more user-friendly clothing management system incorporating social interaction with other users.

Threats Existing web apps can easily develop user interaction features to their existing system which may outrange our web application.
